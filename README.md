# flutter-2024-proj

In this project, we will work on a continuation of our previous web-based application named |--GROCERY-SHOPPING-LIST--|. We will be using the flutter framework. Our platform will have two main CRUD features namely a grocery-shopping list and a list of shops to buy from. 
We will implement effective user registration and authentication, authorization with role based access control system (RBAC), and a functional role assignment mechanism.
